# fMRI Graph Classification: Child vs. Adult Brain States

This project classifies fMRI brain scans as either Child or Adult based on functional connectivity data. We represent each subjectâ€™s brain as a graph derived from correlation matrices and apply both Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Classical Machine Learning Models to compare classification performance.
